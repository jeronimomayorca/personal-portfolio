            I'm from <span className="blue"> Manizales, </span>
            I'm from Manizales, a medium-sized city located in the heart of the coffee axis, known for human kindness, sunsets, coffee, and university culture.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a <span className="blue">creative</span> and <span className="blue">disruptive</span> youngster who questions established norms to find new and better ways of doing things.
            That's why I always look for unconventional alternatives and <span className="underlined">usually come up with great ideas!</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I am a natural problem solver due to my way of thinking and my personality. I learn very quickly and am always seeking continuous improvement,
            focusing my energy on optimizing the product to sustainably increase both users and revenue.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am currently studying Software Engineering at Universidad Iberoamericana de Bogot√° and actively seeking job opportunities.
